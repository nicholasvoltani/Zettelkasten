![[The boundary of the boundary is a subset of the boundary.excalidraw|400]]

Let $S \subseteq X$ be a subset of a [[Topological Space]] $(X, \tau)$.

Let $\partial S$ be its [[Boundary (Topology)|Boundary]]. Then the boundary of the boundary of $S$ is 
$$\partial \partial S = \overline{\partial S} \setminus \mathring{\partial S}$$
Since [[The boundary is a closed set]], we have that
$$\partial \partial S = \partial S \setminus \mathring{\partial S} \subseteq \partial S$$

For equality, we have that [[The boundary of the boundary is the boundary iff the boundary's interior is empty]].
