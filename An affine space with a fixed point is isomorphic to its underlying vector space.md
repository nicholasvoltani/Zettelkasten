![[Fixing a point induces isomorphism between affine space and its vector space.excalidraw]]

Given an affine space $(A, V, +)$, [[Fixing a point in an affine space induces a vector space]]. Fix a point $O \in A$, and call its induced [[Vector Space]] $A_O$.

Then one can easily construct a [[Vector Space Isomorphism]] $T: A_O \leftrightarrow V$, since all points have a unique vector associated to their translation from $O$ (since there is a [[Regular Group Action]]), and since all vectors have an associated point in $A$ which comes from $O$, since the Group Action's domain is defined over the entirety of the additive group $(V, +)$ and is, per hypothesis, [[Free Group Action|Free]] and [[Transitive Group Action|Transitive]] â”€ which ensures that there are no "lazy" vectors: all vectors "induce movement" upon the set $A$.
