![[Group Action induces surjection between group and orbit.excalidraw|400]]

Let $G$ be a [[Group (Mathematics)|Group]] acting upon a set $X$. Let $x \in X$ and $Orb_x$ its [[Orbit of Group Action|Orbit]].

Then the map 
$$\begin{align*}
\varphi: G& \to Orb_x\\
&g \mapsto g \cdot x
\end{align*}
$$
is a surjection, since all points in the orbit have at least some $g \in G$ which take $x$ to it.
