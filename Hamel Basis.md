up:: [[Finitely Generated Vector Space]]

Let $(V, +, \cdot)$ be a finitely generated vector space, and $B \subset V$. Then $B$ is said to be a (Hamel) basis if
- $B$ [[Spanning Set|Span]]s $V$ (by finite [[Linear Combination]]s)
- $B$ is [[Linear Independence|Linearly Independent]] (ensures that all vectors in $V$ have a unique linear combination from $B$)

# Properties
- [[Every finitely generated vector space has a Hamel basis]]
- [[Every finitely generated vector space's bases have the same number of elements]]
- [[Sets larger than a finitely generated space's bases are linearly dependent]]
