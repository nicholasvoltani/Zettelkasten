![[Group as morphisms.excalidraw|300]]

To every [[Group (Mathematics)|Group]] $G$, one can associate a [[Single-Element Category]] $BG$, whose morphisms are all elements in $G$. Due to the algebraic structure of $G$, these morphisms will all be automorphisms (endomorphic & invertible). 

This way, it is straightforward to say that group elements are really symmetry maps: to each element $g \in G$, there is a morphism which preserves this object's structure â”€ such as rotations of $\pi$ for a line ($2$-gon), rotations of $\frac{2\pi}{3}$ for triangles, and so on.
