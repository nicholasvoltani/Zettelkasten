![[Group Action Functor.excalidraw|300]]

Given a [[Group Action]] $\alpha: G \times X \to X$ from a [[Group (Mathematics)|Group]] $G$ onto a set $X$, one can see it as a functor between the associated [[Single-Element Category]] $BG$ and the [[Set Category]] $Set$. In fact, this allows for a generalization of group actions to any type of [[category]].

This point of view leverages the fact that [[Groups can be seen as automorphisms in single-element categories]], from which one sees each group element as a symmetry transformation.
