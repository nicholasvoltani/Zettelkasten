# Intro
Scientists have not only the duty, but the strengths to partake in governance processes of public policies, through systematic and rational decision-making. As Marx said, "If there were no difference between essence and appearance, there would be no need for science", which is why scientists make themselves so important where reality is more nuanced than meets the eye ─ and where failing to recognize this implies in dangerous, even malicious, decision-making.

The importance of complex thinking in today's world is as important as ever: letting go of simplistic, linear models in favor of multifaceted models is key to a better understanding of the world and its processes. 

# About me
As for me, I'm an undergrad in Physics, currently working in the insurance market and hoping to begin my Master's degree in Mathematics next year. What moves me is interdisciplinarity, the refusal to restrict myself to only one area of knowledge when there are so many interesting things out there ─ Physics, Maths, Philosophy, Ecology. My brief passage in the corporate world (although with one too many frustrations) has taught me in practice about the importance of the governance of processes: information transparency, peer reviews, reproducibility of results, and so forth. 

What I've been accustomed to see throughout my Physics degree was a general condescendence towards Philosophy and philosophical thinking, putting mathematical logic above all else, when, in fact, both complement each other: Mathematics teaches clearer thinking, and Philosophy reminds us about human problems (and that they're not simple).
